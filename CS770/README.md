This directory contains a collection of machine learning projects completed during my academic classes and personal growth journey. The projects showcase my proficiency in various machine learning techniques, algorithms, and tools.

These machine learning projects showcase my growth and expertise in applying various algorithms and techniques to real-world datasets. By completing these projects, I have honed my skills in data preprocessing, model implementation, evaluation, and result interpretation.

I am continuously adding more projects to this repository, further expanding my knowledge and skills in machine learning. I am excited about the potential applications of machine learning in solving complex problems and look forward to contributing to the field.

Note: Please refer to the individual project reports for more detailed information, methodology, and results.

Thank you for visiting the repository!
