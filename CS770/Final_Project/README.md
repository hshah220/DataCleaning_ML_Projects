As part of my Introduction to Machine Learning class, I conducted a project focused on iris flower species classification. I developed a predictive model using supervised learning techniques to accurately predict the species based on sepal and petal measurements.

Key Accomplishments:
1. Implemented and compared the performance of three classifiers: Logistic Regression, K Nearest Neighbors Classifier, and AdaBoostClassifier.
2. Evaluated each classifier's ability to classify iris flowers based on the provided features.
3. Explored ensemble learning by developing an ensemble classifier that combined the predictions of the three classifiers using a majority voting rule.
4. Conducted thorough data analysis, preprocessing, and feature engineering to ensure high-quality input data.
5. Leveraged popular machine learning libraries and optimized classifier parameters for improved performance.
6. Gained practical experience in applying supervised learning algorithms and evaluating their performance.
7. Acquired a deeper understanding of data preprocessing techniques, feature selection, and model evaluation.
8. Showcased analytical skills, problem-solving abilities, and proficiency in implementing machine learning algorithms.
9. Effectively interpreted and communicated project results.
